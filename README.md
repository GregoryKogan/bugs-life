# Bugs-Life

This is my first big project.
This is simulation of how bugs live.

Of course it's not precise and has no scientific power.
But it still very interisting to make set of creatures and watch of them evolving and interracting with each other
and environment.

There are few specs of every creature. How creature looks highly depends on it specs.

If creature is a predator it has a white oval on his back perpendicular to his body.

If creature is herbivourous it has a white oval on his back parallel to to his body.

If creature is omnivourous it has both ovals.

The older the creature the longer it's tail.

If creature is lazy it has little pompons on it's ears and tail.

If creature is brave it has no middle legs.

Amount of energy that creature can store in it's body is represented with size of it.

The bigger creature, the slower it is.

Every creature has different lifespan. If creature is alive by the end of it's lifespan
it dies, but make random amount of children.

Children have exactly same color as their parent, but other specs of children can be differnt from parent's.
With chance of 1 to 8 every spec of child can change from it parent's.

So it's simulation of evolution (kind of). At the end there are only creatures that are best fit environment.

Environment is controllable, you can change size of the field and amount of food on it.

Balanced set button creates 7 creatures with polar different specs.

Random set button creates renadom amount of creature with reandom specs.

You can manualy change each creature specs with 'Change' button.
Changed creatures become white.

'Show insides' button shows how creatures think and why they move like they move.
